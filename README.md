# LED_Gravity_Cube
LED_Gravity_Cube is a DIY project featuring a cube with an 8x8 LED matrix on the top face and an accelerometer inside. The project uses an ATMega328P-U microcontroller to control LED matrix and communicate with accelerometer. The LED matrix displays 8 points (dots) that move in response to the cubeâ€™s tilt, simulating the behavior of physical balls rolling due to gravity. The cube's case was 3D printed.
